@ARTICLE{Hoegh-Guldberg1999-rb,
  title     = "Climate change, coral bleaching and the future of the world's
               coral reefs",
  author    = "Hoegh-Guldberg, Ove",
  abstract  = "Sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by
               almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing
               at ~1--2°C per century. Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal
               tolerance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts
               (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred
               in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over
               the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae
               following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted
               in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world.
               This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and
               ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the
               outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change
               which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the
               frequency and intensity of bleaching events will change over the
               next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal tolerances
               of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year
               within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event,
               the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20
               years. Most information suggests that the capacity for
               acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that
               adaptation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of
               the world’s reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are
               predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine
               ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur
               without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global
               scale.",

  abstract  = "During the past decade, acute and chronic bleaching of tropical
               reef corals has occurred with increasing frequency and scale.
               Bleaching, i.e., the loss of pigment and the decrease in
               population density of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae),
               is often correlated with an increase or decrease in sea surface
               temperature. Because little is known of the cellular events
               concomitant with thermal bleaching, we have investigated the
               mechanism of release of zooxanthellae by the tropical sea
               anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the reef coral Pocillopora
               damicornis in response to cold and heat stress. Both species
               released intact host endoderm cells containing zooxanthellae.
               The majority of the released host cells were viable, but they
               soon disintegrated in the seawater leaving behind isolated
               zooxanthellae. The detachment and release of intact host cells
               suggests that thermal stress causes host cell adhesion
               dysfunction in these cnidarians. Knowledge of the cellular
               entity released by the host during bleaching provides insight
               into both the underlying release mechanism and the way in which
               natural environmental stresses evoke a bleaching response.",

               investigate this, two key and inextricably coupled indicators of

               the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora millepora over a two-year
               period that included a natural bleaching event. In the absence

               lower stored lipids compared to C2 colonies. At spawning time,
               this correlated with 28\% smaller eggs in type-D colonies. This

               implications for coral response to climate change",
  author    = "Silverstein, Rachel N and Correa, Adrienne M S and Baker, Andrew
               C",
  abstract  = "Some reef-building corals have been shown to respond to
               environmental change by shifting the composition of their algal
               symbiont (genus Symbiodinium) communities. These shifts have
               been proposed as a potential mechanism by which corals might
               survive climate stressors, such as increased temperatures.
               Conventional molecular methods suggest this adaptive capacity
               may not be widespread because few (∼25\%) coral species have
               been found to associate with multiple Symbiodinium clades.
               However, these methods can fail to detect low abundance
               symbionts (typically less than 10--20\% of the total algal
               symbiont community). To determine whether additional
               Symbiodinium clades are present, but are not detected using
               conventional techniques, we applied a high-resolution, real-time
               PCR assay to survey Symbiodinium (in clades A--D) from 39
               species of phylogenetically and geographically diverse
               scleractinian corals. This survey included 26 coral species
               thought to be restricted to hosting a single Symbiodinium clade
               (‘symbiotic specialists’). We detected at least two Symbiodinium
               clades (C and D) in at least one sample of all 39 coral species
               tested; all four Symbiodinium clades were detected in over half
               (54\%) of the 26 symbiotic specialist coral species.
               Furthermore, on average, 68 per cent of all sampled colonies
               within a given coral species hosted two or more symbiont clades.
               We conclude that the ability to associate with multiple symbiont
               clades is common in scleractinian (stony) corals, and that, in
               coral--algal symbiosis, ‘specificity’ and ‘flexibility’ are
               relative terms: specificity is rarely absolute. The potential
               for reef corals to adapt or acclimatize to environmental change
               via symbiont community shifts may therefore be more
               phylogenetically widespread than has previously been assumed.",

                 the ability of corals to adapt or acclimatize to increased
                 temperature extremes over the next few decades. Many coral
                 species are highly sensitive to temperature stress and the
                 number of stress (bleaching) episodes has increased in recent

                 Acropora millepora, a common and widespread Indo-Pacific hard
                 coral species, through transplantation and experimental
                 manipulation. We show that adult corals, at least in some
                 circumstances, are capable of acquiring increased thermal
                 tolerance and that the increased tolerance is a direct result
                 of a change in the symbiont type dominating their tissues from

                 exogenous uptake from the environment. The level of increased
                 tolerance gained by the corals changing their dominant
                 symbiont type to D (the most thermally resistant type known)
                 is around 1-1.5 degrees C. This is the first study to show
                 that thermal acclimatization is causally related to symbiont

                 the absence of other mechanisms of thermal
                 acclimatization/adaptation, it may not be sufficient to
                 survive climate change under predicted sea surface temperature

               are defined as mutualistic because both partners receive benefit
               from the association via the exchange of nutrients. This
               successful interaction underpins the growth and formation of
               coral reefs. The symbiotic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium is
               genetically diverse containing eight divergent lineages (clades
               A--H). Corals predominantly associate with clade C Symbiodinium

               in the function and interactive physiology of different
               coral--dinoflagellate assemblages is virtually unexplored but is
               an important consideration when developing the contextual

               In this study, we present evidence that clade A Symbiodinium are

               Symbiodinium and may represent parasitic rather than mutualistic

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The algal endosymbionts (genus Symbiodinium)
                 associated with scleractinian corals (and other reef
                 invertebrates) have received a lot of research attention in
                 the past decade, particularly as certain host-symbiont
                 associations appear more affected by increasing seawater
                 temperatures than others. With the rapid accumulation of
                 information on the diversity of Symbiodinium, it is becoming
                 increasingly difficult to compare newly acquired Symbiodinium
                 data with existing data to detect patterns of host-symbiont
                 specificity on broader spatial scales. The lack of a general
                 consensus on the classification of Symbiodinium species
                 coupled with the variety of different markers used to identify
                 the genus Symbiodinium (ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1/D2, chloroplast 23S
                 rDNA and psbA minicircle) further complicate direct
                 comparison. DESCRIPTION: The SymbioGBR database compiles all
                 currently available Symbiodinium sequences and associated host
                 information of data collected from the Great Barrier Reef into
                 a single relational database that is accessible via a
                 user-friendly, searchable web-based application
                 (http://www.SymbioGBR.org). SymbioGBR allows users to query
                 Symbiodinium types or sequences sourced from various genetic
                 markers (e.g. ITS1, ITS2, LSU D1/D2 and chloroplast 23S) and
                 invertebrate host species to explore their reported
                 associations. In addition, as the database includes sequence
                 information of multiple genetic markers, it allows
                 cross-referencing between conventional (e.g. ITS2 region) and
                 novel markers that exhibit low intragenomic variability (e.g.
                 psbA region). Finally, the database is based on the collection
                 details of individual specimens. Such host-symbiont
                 associations can be assessed quantitatively and viewed in
                 relation to their environmental and geographic context.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The SymbioGBR database provides a comprehensive
                 overview of Symbiodinium diversity and host-associations on
                 the Great Barrier Reef. It provides a quick, user-friendly
                 means to compare newly acquired data on Symbiodinium (e.g. raw
                 sequences or characterized Symbiodinium types) with previous
                 data on the diversity of invertebrate host-symbiont
                 associations on the GBR. The inclusion of psbAncr sequence
                 information allows for validation of widely used ITS1/ITS2
                 markers and their ability to accurately identify relevant
                 sequences. Most importantly, centralization of sequence
                 information from multiple genetic markers will aid the
                 classification of Symbiodinium species diversity and allow
                 researchers to easily compare patterns of host-Symbiodinium
                 associations.",

               micro-eukaryotes) that contribute to the functional attributes
               of the host organism. Scleractinian corals represent
               particularly provocative subjects for study in this context
               because they are morphologically complex and associate with a
               broad diversity of macro invertebrates and vertebrates as well
               as microorganisms. Representatives of all these taxonomic
               groupings have been shown to contribute to the function of
               corals through direct or indirect provisioning and cycling of
               nutrients, waste removal, defense, and stress tolerance, traits
               that influence the fitness and environmental thresholds of
               individual coral colonies. How the taxonomic composition,
               functional limits and interactive nature of members of these
               communities vary among and within host species, and scale up to
               influence community level processes that drive ecosystem
               structure and function through time and space is unknown; these
               communities are, however, taxonomically variable among
               individual corals. Here we draw on the published literature to
               discuss the ecological and functional significance of the broad
               and variable taxonomic symbioses found closely associated with
               corals. Using a comparative approach, we hypothesize that the
               intra-specific and inter-specific variations in response of
               corals to environmental disturbance is linked to differences in
               the specificity, nature and composition of these symbiotic
               assemblages and reflect variation in the architectural
               complexity (micro and macro) and capacity of corals to provision
               habitat. We describe individual coral colonies as symbiomes,
               unique micro-ecosystems bounded by the physical limits of the
               coral colony whose performance limits reflect the taxonomic
               range of the associates (micro and macro) found within the
               colony. We explicitly recognize the fact that corals represent
               complex ecological communities composed of organisms that have

               dinoflagellate endosymbionts is a key factor in the evolutionary
               success of hermatypic (reef building) corals. The endosymbiotic
               algae benefit corals in numerous ways that have contributed to
               the long term persistence of coral reefs over geologic time. In
               this chapter we review ecological and physiological aspects of
               the interactions between corals and their symbiotic algae in
               light of recent advances in our knowledge of the diversity of
               these symbionts. While the role of symbiont diversity in
               promoting coral survival during environmental bleaching events
               has been a major focus of recent research, its importance in
               other physiological and ecological contexts such as inorganic
               nutrient dynamics and photosynthetic carbon fluxes has received
               much less attention. We suggest that cost-benefit analysis is a
               useful approach to examine these symbioses in the context of
               environmental change and human impacts upon corals and coral
               reefs. Weighing the costs versus the benefits of the symbiotic
               association under specific environmental perturbations has
               potential for use as an indicator of the health of not only
               corals but indeed the whole coral reef ecosystem. Drastic
               changes in the stability of the symbiosis, evidenced by changes
               in the ratio of zooxanthellae to animal biomass in corals, may
               turn out to be a useful diagnostic indicator of stresses to
               coral reefs. By using new tools developed to assess the
               stability of the symbiosis, we may be better able to understand

                 different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics,
                 phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and
                 testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs
                 now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are
                 often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or
                 impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce.
                 The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these
                 analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its
                 extensions (packages), but with limited support for high
                 throughput microbiome census data. RESULTS: Here we describe a
                 software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented
                 representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It
                 supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as
                 well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration,
                 filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons,

                 in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We
                 show how to apply functions from other R packages to
                 phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a
                 large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss
                 the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a
                 practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis

                 make up the majority of the observed membership, yet the
                 contribution of this microbial ``rare biosphere'' to community
                 dynamics is unclear. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of
                 3,237 samples from 42 time series of microbial communities
                 from nine different ecosystems (air; marine; lake; stream;
                 adult human skin, tongue, and gut; infant gut; and brewery
                 wastewater treatment), we introduce a new method to detect
                 typically rare microbial taxa that occasionally become very
                 abundant (conditionally rare taxa [CRT]) and then quantify
                 their contributions to temporal shifts in community structure.
                 We discovered that CRT made up 1.5 to 28\% of the community
                 membership, represented a broad diversity of bacterial and
                 archaeal lineages, and explained large amounts of temporal
                 community dissimilarity (i.e., up to 97\% of Bray-Curtis
                 dissimilarity). Most of the CRT were detected at multiple time
                 points, though we also identified ``one-hit wonder'' CRT that
                 were observed at only one time point. Using a case study from
                 a temperate lake, we gained additional insights into the
                 ecology of CRT by comparing routine community time series to
                 large disturbance events. Our results reveal that many rare
                 taxa contribute a greater amount to microbial community
                 dynamics than is apparent from their low proportional
                 abundances. This observation was true across a wide range of
                 ecosystems, indicating that these rare taxa are essential for
                 understanding community changes over time. Importance:
                 Microbial communities and their processes are the foundations
                 of ecosystems. The ecological roles of rare microorganisms are
                 largely unknown, but it is thought that they contribute to
                 community stability by acting as a reservoir that can rapidly
                 respond to environmental changes. We investigated the
                 occurrence of typically rare taxa that very occasionally
                 become more prominent in their communities (``conditionally
                 rare''). We quantified conditionally rare taxa in time series
                 from a wide variety of ecosystems and discovered that not only
                 were conditionally rare taxa present in all of the examples,
                 but they also contributed disproportionately to temporal
                 changes in diversity when they were most abundant. This result
                 indicates an important and general role for rare microbial
                 taxa within their communities.",

                 thermally resilient corals to identify the molecular pathways

               ecosystems on the planet. In addition to their value in terms of
               biodiversity, coral reefs provide food and resources for over
               500 million people. Despite their importance, coral reefs are
               declining at a rapid rate (1--2\% per year) as a result of a
               range of local (e.g., overexploitation of fisheries, declining
               water quality) and global (e.g., global warming and ocean
               acidification) drivers. Extensive experimental and field
               evidence suggests that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
               of 450 ppm will lead to the loss of coral-dominated reef
               systems, with the prospect that dangerous levels of atmospheric
               carbon dioxide for coral reefs were exceeded in 1979 when mass
               coral bleaching was reported for the first time. The exact
               response of coral reefs remains uncertain although it is highly
               unlikely that coral-dominated reef systems will be present in
               future oceans at the current rate of warming and acidification
               of the world’s tropical oceans. The loss of these important
               coastal ecosystems will diminish the resources available to
               hundreds of millions of people along tropical coastlines.
               Understanding the impacts on people and industry is an
               imperative if we are to devise effective systems by which
               tropical coastal communities are to adapt to rapidly changing
               tropical coastal environments. Our current understanding of
               these important issues, however, is in a relatively undeveloped
               state and must be a priority of future research.",

                 of the organisms inhabiting them, as well as those that have
                 led to existing patterns of coral reef biodiversity. The
                 scleractinian (stony) corals deposit the structural framework
                 that supports and promotes the maintenance of biological
                 diversity and complexity of coral reefs, and as such, are
                 major components of these ecosystems. The success of
                 reef-building corals is related to their obligate symbiotic
                 association with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium.
                 These one-celled algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) live in the
                 endodermal tissues of their coral host, provide most of the
                 host's energy budget and promote rapid calcification.
                 Furthermore, zooxanthellae are the main primary producers on
                 coral reefs due to the oligotrophic nature of the surrounding
                 waters. In this review paper, we summarize and critically
                 evaluate studies that have employed genetics and/or molecular
                 biology in examining questions relating to the evolution and

               (37 species), and gonochoristic brooders (7 species) have also
               been reported. Characteristics of sexuality and mode of
               reproduction are generally conservative within species, genera,
               and even families, although some exceptions occur. Variation in
               timing or mode of reproduction in allopatric populations may
               represent adaptations to local environmental conditions or
               indicate problems in the taxonomy of some groups. Synchronous
               spawning of numerous species occurs on the Great Barrier Reef,

              Symbiodinium has been intensively studied for over 50 years,
              genetic transformation of Symbiodinium has seen little success

                 inheritance (vertical transmission) or acquired anew each
                 generation from the environment (horizontal transmission).
                 With vertical symbiont transmission, progeny benefit by not
                 having to search for their obligate symbionts, and, with
                 symbiont inheritance, a mechanism exists for perpetuating
                 advantageous symbionts. But, if the progeny encounter an
                 environment that differs from that of their parent, they may
                 be disadvantaged if the inherited symbionts prove suboptimal.
                 Conversely, while in horizontal symbiont acquisition host
                 survival hinges on an unpredictable symbiont source, an
                 individual host may acquire genetically diverse symbionts well
                 suited to any given environment. In horizontal acquisition,
                 however, a potentially advantageous symbiont will not be
                 transmitted to subsequent generations. Adaptation in obligate
                 symbioses may require mechanisms for both novel symbiont
                 acquisition and symbiont inheritance. Using
                 denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR, we

                 horizontal symbiont acquisition strategies. By releasing
                 progeny with maternally derived symbionts, that are also
                 capable of subsequent horizontal symbiont acquisition, coral
                 colonies may acquire physiologically advantageous novel
                 symbionts that are then perpetuated via vertical transmission
                 to subsequent generations. With symbiont inheritance, natural
                 selection can act upon the symbiotic variability, providing a

                 considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence,
                 with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatization
                 mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental effects
                 that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization
                 (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important
                 contributors to offspring response in other systems. We
                 present the first evidence of parental effects in a
                 cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in
                 reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9°C,

                 temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding
                 period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult

                 dynamics is largely unknown, especially in diverse systems.
                 For example, few studies have explored the role of diversity
                 in tropical marine communities, especially at large scales. We
                 tested the diversity-stability hypothesis by asking whether
                 coral richness is related to resistance to and recovery from
                 disturbances including storms, predator outbreaks, and coral
                 bleaching on tropical coral reefs. We synthesized the results
                 of 41 field studies conducted on 82 reefs, documenting changes
                 in coral cover due to disturbance, across a global gradient of
                 coral richness. Our results indicate that coral reefs in more
                 species-rich regions were marginally less resistant to
                 disturbance and did not recover more quickly. Coral community
                 resistance was also highly dependent on pre-disturbance coral
                 cover, probably due in part to the sensitivity of fast-growing
                 and often dominant plating acroporid corals to disturbance.
                 Our results suggest that coral communities in biodiverse
                 regions, such as the western Pacific, may not be more
                 resistant and resilient to natural and anthropogenic
                 disturbances. Further analyses controlling for disturbance

               Algal endosymbionts, specifically the dinoflagellate genus
               Symbiodinium, are divided into several genetic clades. The
               composition of Symbiodinium within corals plays an important
               role in the tolerance and/or sensitivity of host corals to local
               environments, due to individual Symbiodinium-specific
               physiological characteristics. While the majority of
               gamete-spawning corals acquire Symbiodinium from the surrounding
               environment, little is known about whether corals specifically
               select or randomly acquire Symbiodinium from the environmental
               population. In the present study, we compared the Symbiodinium
               clade composition of newly recruited Acropora corals with that
               of the environmental pool (water column, sediments, and adult
               colonies). More than 90 \% of recruits harbored clades A and/or
               D until 6 months after settlement, despite the Symbiodinium
               environmental pool being mainly composed of clade C (mainly ITS1
               type C2), and to a lesser extent clades A and D. In addition,
               the environmentally dominant type C2 Symbiodinium was not
               detected in Acropora recruits, while a few recruits harbored
               ITS1 types C1 or C15. Therefore, the clade composition of
               recruits may not reflect the abundance/density of Symbiodinium
               populations in the environment. Some members of clades A and D
               are known to exhibit tolerance to a wide range of environments.
               ITS1 type C1 also exhibits greater tolerance to thermal stress
               compared to ITS1 type C2. These tolerance characteristics of
               certain Symbiodinium may be vital for the initial survival of
               Acropora recruits, even if these Symbiodinium are rare in the

                 dinoflagellate alga Symbiodinium is essential for the
                 development and survival of coral reefs. Yet this fragile
                 association is highly vulnerable to environmental disturbance.
                 A coral's ability to tolerate temperature stress depends on
                 the fitness of its resident symbionts, whose thermal optima
                 vary extensively between lineages. However, the in hospite
                 population genetic structure of Symbiodinium is poorly
                 understood and mostly based on analysis of bulk DNA extracted
                 from thousands to millions of cells. Using quantitative
                 single-cell PCR, we enumerated DNA polymorphisms in the
                 symbionts of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis,
                 and applied a model selection approach to explore the
                 potential for recombination between coexisting Symbiodinium
                 populations. RESULTS: Two distinct Symbiodinium ITS2 sequences
                 (denoted C100 and C109) were retrieved from all P. damicornis
                 colonies analysed. However, the symbiont assemblage consisted
                 of three distinct Symbiodinium populations: cells featuring
                 pure arrays of ITS2 type C109, near-homogeneous cells of type
                 C100 (with trace ITS2 copies of type C109), and those with
                 co-dominant C100 and C109 ITS2 repeats. The symbiont consortia
                 of some colonies consisted almost entirely of these putative
                 C100 $\times$ C109 recombinants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are
                 consistent with the occurrence of sexual recombination between
                 Symbiodinium types C100 and C109. While the multiple-copy
                 nature of the ITS2 dictates that the observed pattern of
                 intra-genomic co-dominance may be a result of incomplete
                 concerted evolution of intra-genomic polymorphisms, this is a
                 less likely explanation given the occurrence of homogeneous
                 cells of the C109 type. Conclusive evidence for inter-lineage
                 recombination and introgression in this genus will require
                 either direct observational evidence or a single-cell

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus
                 Symbiodinium) within coral reef invertebrates are critical to
                 the survival of the holobiont. The genetic variability of
                 Symbiodinium may contribute to the tolerance of the symbiotic
                 association to elevated sea surface temperatures (SST). To
                 assess the importance of factors such as the local
                 environment, host identity and biogeography in driving
                 Symbiodinium distributions on reef-wide scales, data from
                 studies on reef invertebrate-Symbiodinium associations from
                 the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were compiled.
                 METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The resulting database
                 consisted of 3717 entries from 26 studies. It was used to
                 explore ecological patterns such as host-specificity and
                 environmental drivers structuring community complexity using a
                 multi-scalar approach. The data was analyzed in several ways:
                 (i) frequently sampled host species were analyzed
                 independently to investigate the influence of the environment
                 on symbiont distributions, thereby excluding the influence of
                 host specificity, (ii) host species distributions across sites
                 were added as an environmental variable to determine the
                 contribution of host identity on symbiont distribution, and
                 (iii) data were pooled based on clade (broad genetic groups
                 dividing the genus Symbiodinium) to investigate factors
                 driving Symbiodinium distributions using lower taxonomic
                 resolution. The results indicated that host species identity
                 plays a dominant role in determining the distribution of
                 Symbiodinium and environmental variables shape distributions
                 on a host species-specific level. SST derived variables
                 (especially SSTstdev) most often contributed to the selection
                 of the best model. Clade level comparisons decreased the power
                 of the predictive model indicating that it fails to
                 incorporate the main drivers behind Symbiodinium
                 distributions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Including the
                 influence of different host species on Symbiodinium
                 distributional patterns improves our understanding of the
                 drivers behind the complexity of Symbiodinium-invertebrate
                 symbioses. This will increase our ability to generate
                 realistic models estimating the risk reefs are exposed to and
                 their resilience in response to a changing climate.",

  abstract    = "Mutualistic organisms can be particularly susceptible to
                 climate change stress, as their survivorship is often limited
                 by the most vulnerable partner. However, symbiotic plasticity
                 can also help organisms in changing environments by expanding
                 their realized niche space. Coral-algal (Symbiodinium spp.)
                 symbiosis exemplifies this dichotomy: the partnership is
                 highly susceptible to 'bleaching' (stress-induced symbiosis
                 breakdown), but stress-tolerant symbionts can also sometimes
                 mitigate bleaching. Here, we investigate the role of diverse
                 and mutable symbiotic partnerships in increasing corals'
                 ability to thrive in high temperature conditions. We conducted
                 repeat bleaching and recovery experiments on the coral
                 Montastraea cavernosa, and used quantitative PCR and
                 chlorophyll fluorometry to assess the structure and function
                 of Symbiodinium communities within coral hosts. During an
                 initial heat exposure (32 °C for 10 days), corals hosting only
                 stress-sensitive symbionts (Symbiodinium C3) bleached, but
                 recovered (at either 24 °C or 29 °C) with predominantly
                 (>90\%) stress-tolerant symbionts (Symbiodinium D1a), which
                 were not detected before bleaching (either due to absence or
                 extreme low abundance). When a second heat stress (also 32 °C
                 for 10 days) was applied 3 months later, corals that
                 previously bleached and were now dominated by D1a Symbiodinium
                 experienced less photodamage and symbiont loss compared to
                 control corals that had not been previously bleached, and were
                 therefore still dominated by Symbiodinium C3. Additional
                 corals that were initially bleached without heat by a
                 herbicide (DCMU, at 24 °C) also recovered predominantly with
                 D1a symbionts, and similarly lost fewer symbionts during
                 subsequent thermal stress. Increased thermotolerance was also
                 not observed in C3-dominated corals that were acclimated for 3
                 months to warmer temperatures (29 °C) before heat stress.
                 These findings indicate that increased thermotolerance
                 post-bleaching resulted from symbiont community composition
                 changes, not prior heat exposure. Moreover, initially
                 undetectable D1a symbionts became dominant only after
                 bleaching, and were critical to corals' resilience after
                 stress and resistance to future stress.",

  abstract    = "Even in the absence of major disturbances (e.g., cyclones,
                 bleaching), corals are subject to high levels of partial or
                 whole-colony mortality, often caused by chronic and
                 small-scale disturbances. Depending on levels of background

                 fitness and have significant consequences on the ability of
                 colonies to withstand subsequent acute disturbances or
                 environmental change. This study quantified intraspecific
                 variations in physiological condition (measured based on total
                 lipid content and zooxanthellae density) through time in adult
                 colonies of two common and widespread coral species (Acropora

                 levels of biological and physical disturbances along the most
                 disturbed reef habitat, the crest. Marked intraspecific
                 variation in the physiological condition of A. spathulata was
                 clearly linked to differences in local disturbance regimes and
                 habitat. Specifically, zooxanthellae density decreased (r2 =
                 26, df = 5,42, p<0.02, B = -121255, p = 0.03) and total lipid
                 content increased (r2 = 14, df = 5,42, p = 0.01, B = 0.9, p =
                 0.01) with increasing distance from exposed crests. Moreover,
                 zooxanthellae density was strongly and negatively correlated
                 with the individual level of partial mortality (r2 = 26, df =
                 5,42, p<0.02, B = -7386077, p = 0.01). Conversely, P.
                 damicornis exhibited very limited intraspecific variation in
                 physiological condition, despite marked differences in levels
                 of partial mortality. This is the first study to relate
                 intraspecific variation in the condition of corals to
                 localized differences in chronic disturbance regimes. The next
                 step is to ascertain whether these differences have further

  abstract    = "Holobionts are species-specific associations between macro-
                 and microorganisms. On coral reefs, the benthic coverage of
                 coral and algal holobionts varies due to natural and
                 anthropogenic forcings. Different benthic macroorganisms are
                 predicted to have specific microbiomes. In contrast, local
                 environmental factors are predicted to select for specific
                 metabolic pathways in microbes. To reconcile these two
                 predictions, we hypothesized that adaptation of microbiomes to
                 local conditions is facilitated by the horizontal transfer of
                 genes responsible for specific metabolic capabilities. To test
                 this hypothesis, microbial metagenomes were sequenced from 22
                 coral reefs at 11 Line Islands in the central Pacific that
                 together span a wide range of biogeochemical and anthropogenic
                 influences. Consistent with our hypothesis, the percent cover
                 of major benthic functional groups significantly correlated
                 with particular microbial taxa. Reefs with higher coral cover
                 had a coral microbiome with higher abundances of
                 Alphaproteobacteria (such as Rhodobacterales and
                 Sphingomonadales), whereas microbiomes of algae-dominated
                 reefs had higher abundances of Gammaproteobacteria (such as
                 Alteromonadales, Pseudomonadales, and Vibrionales),
                 Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteriodetes. In contrast to taxa,
                 geography was the strongest predictor of microbial community
                 metabolism. Microbial communities on reefs with higher
                 nutrient availability (e.g., equatorial upwelling zones) were
                 enriched in genes involved in nutrient-related metabolisms
                 (e.g., nitrate and nitrite ammonification, Ton/Tol transport,
                 etc.). On reefs further from the equator, microbes had more
                 genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosystems I/II.
                 These results support the hypothesis that core microbiomes are
                 determined by holobiont macroorganisms, and that those core
                 taxa adapt to local conditions by selecting for advantageous
                 metabolic genes.",

                 stable holobiont members. To test this hypothesis, the
                 bacterial communities associated with three coral species
                 (Acropora rosaria, Acropora hyacinthus and Porites lutea) and
                 two algal guilds (crustose coralline algae and turf algae)
                 from 131 samples were analyzed using a novel statistical
                 approach termed the Abundance-Ubiquity (AU) test. The AU test
                 determines whether a given bacterial species would be present
                 given additional sampling effort (that is, stable) versus

                 Using the AU test, we show that coral and algal holobionts
                 have a high-diversity group of stable symbionts. Stable
                 symbionts are not exclusive to one species of coral or algae.
                 No single bacterial species was ubiquitously associated with
                 one host, showing that there is not strict heredity of the

                 tropics, and are projected to increase in frequency and
                 severity. If bleaching becomes an annual event later in this
                 century, more than 90\% of coral reefs worldwide may be at
                 risk of long-term degradation. While corals can recover from
                 single isolated bleaching and can acclimate to recurring
                 bleaching events that are separated by multiple years, it is
                 currently unknown if and how they will survive and possibly
                 acclimatize to annual coral bleaching. Here, we demonstrate
                 for the first time that annual coral bleaching can
                 dramatically alter thermal tolerance in Caribbean corals. We
                 found that high coral energy reserves and changes in the
                 dominant algal endosymbiont type (Symbiodinium spp.)
                 facilitated rapid acclimation in Porites divaricata, whereas
                 low energy reserves and a lack of algal phenotypic plasticity
                 significantly increased susceptibility in Porites astreoides
                 to bleaching the following year. Phenotypic plasticity in the
                 dominant endosymbiont type of Orbicella faveolata did not
                 prevent repeat bleaching, but may have facilitated rapid
                 recovery. Thus, coral holobiont response to an isolated single
                 bleaching event is not an accurate predictor of its response
                 to bleaching the following year. Rather, the cumulative impact
                 of annual coral bleaching can turn some coral species
                 'winners' into 'losers', and can also facilitate acclimation
                 and turn some coral species 'losers' into 'winners'. Overall,
                 these findings indicate that cumulative impact of annual coral
                 bleaching could result in some species becoming increasingly
                 susceptible to bleaching and face a long-term decline, while
                 phenotypically plastic coral species will acclimatize and
                 persist. Thus, annual coral bleaching and recovery could
                 contribute to the selective loss of coral diversity as well as
                 the overall decline of coral reefs in the Caribbean.",

              exacerbated when coupled with eutrophication, i.e., increasing
              plankton, inorganic nutrient concentrations, sedimentation and
              turbidity due to coastal urbanization. Whereas zooplankton
              provision (heterotrophy) may alleviate the negative consequences
              of thermal stress, inorganic nutrient supply may exacerbate them,
              which creates a paradox. Our experimental study aims to
              disentangle the effects of these two components of eutrophication
              on the physiological response of Turbinaria reniformis subject to
              normal and to a short-term temperature increase. Additionally,
              three different inorganic nutrient ratios were tested to assess
              the influence of nutrient stoichiometry on coral physiology:
              control (ambient SW 0.5 $\mu$M N and 0.1 $\mu$M P), N only
              (ambient + 2 $\mu$M N) and N + P (ambient + 2 $\mu$M N and + 0.5
              $\mu$M P). Our results show a deleterious effect of a 2 $\mu$M
              nitrate enrichment alone (N) on coral photosynthetic processes
              under thermal stress as well as on calcification rates when
              associated with heterotrophy. On the contrary, a coupled nitrate
              and phosphorus enrichment (N + P) maintained coral metabolism and
              calcification during thermal stress and enhanced them when
              combined with heterotrophy. Broadly, our results shed light on
              the tight relationship existing between inorganic nutrient
              availability and heterotrophy. Moreover, it assesses the
              relevance of N: P stoichiometry as a determining factor for the

  abstract    = "Coral reefs are in decline worldwide. Much of this decline is
                 attributable to mass coral bleaching events and disease
                 outbreaks, both of which are linked to anthropogenic climate
                 change. Despite increased research effort, much remains
                 unknown about these phenomena, especially the causative agents
                 of many coral diseases. In particular, coral-associated
                 viruses have received little attention, and their potential
                 roles in coral diseases are largely unknown. Previous
                 microscopy studies have produced evidence of viral infections
                 in Symbiodinium, the endosymbiotic algae critical for coral
                 survival, and more recently molecular evidence of
                 Symbiodinium-infecting viruses has emerged from metagenomic
                 studies of corals. Here, we took an exploratory
                 whole-transcriptome approach to virus gene discovery in three
                 different Symbiodinium cultures. An array of virus-like genes
                 was found in each of the transcriptomes, with the majority
                 apparently belonging to the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA
                 viruses. Upregulation of virus-like gene expression following
                 stress experiments indicated that Symbiodinium cells may host
                 latent or persistent viral infections that are induced via
                 stress. This was supported by analysis of host gene
                 expression, which showed changes consistent with viral
                 infection after exposure to stress. If these results can be
                 replicated in Symbiodinium cells in hospite, they could help
                 to explain the breakdown of the coral-Symbiodinium symbiosis,
                 and possibly some of the numerous coral diseases that have yet
                 to be assigned a causative agent.",

                 and behaviour of their hosts, and can respond very rapidly to
                 changing environmental conditions, providing a powerful
                 mechanism for acclimatisation and also possibly rapid
                 evolution of coral reef holobionts. Environmentally acquired
                 fluctuations in the microbiome can have significant functional
                 consequences for the holobiont phenotype upon which selection
                 can act. Environmentally induced changes in microbial
                 abundance may be analogous to host gene duplication, symbiont
                 switching / shuffling as a result of environmental change can
                 either remove or introduce raw genetic material into the

                 evolution within microbial strains. Vertical transmission of
                 symbionts is a key feature of many reef holobionts and this

                 species, propose a modified Price equation as a framework for

               photosynthetic symbionts or their pigments. Although bleaching
               leaves the coral skeleton visible under its transparent tissue,
               not all white coral colonies display this feature. This raises

                 believed to be limited to the Symbiodinium types already
                 present in the coral tissue acquired during early life stages.
                 Compelling evidence for symbiont switching, that is, the
                 acquisition of novel Symbiodinium types from the environment,
                 by adult coral colonies, is currently lacking. Using deep
                 sequencing analysis of Symbiodinium rDNA internal transcribed
                 spacer 2 (ITS2) PCR amplicons from two pocilloporid coral

                 of Symbiodinium types from the environment by adult corals
                 following two consecutive bleaching events. Most of these
                 newly detected symbionts remained in the rare biosphere
                 (background types occurring below 1\% relative abundance), but
                 one novel type reached a relative abundance of ~33\%. Two de
                 novo acquired Symbiodinium types belong to the thermally
                 resistant clade D, suggesting that this switching may have
                 been driven by consecutive thermal bleaching events. Our
                 results are particularly important given the maternal mode of
                 Symbiodinium transmission in the study species, which
                 generally results in high symbiont specificity. These findings
                 will cause a paradigm shift in our understanding of

                 geographic extent as the climate warms. A fundamental question

               Symbiodinium spp. (dinoflagellates) that occur at low abundances

               Evidence acquired from extensive sampling, long-term monitoring,
               and experimental manipulation can allow us to deduce the ecology
               and functional significance of these populations and whether
               they might contribute to the response of coral-dinoflagellate
               mutualisms to climate change. Quantitative PCR was used here to
               diagnose the prevalence, seasonal variation, and abundances of
               Symbiodinium spp. within and between colonies of the coral,
               Alveopora japonica. Consistent with broader geographic sampling,
               only one species comprised 99.9 \%, or greater, the population
               of symbionts in every sample. However, other Symbiodinium
               including the non-mutualistic species, Symbiodinium voratum,
               were often detected, but at estimated cell densities
               thousands-fold less than the dominant symbiont. The temporal
               variation in prevalence and abundances of these ``background''
               Symbiodinium could not be definitively related to any particular
               environmental factor including seasonality and water chemistry.
               The prevalence (proportion detected among host samples), but not
               abundance, of S. voratum may weakly correspond to increases in
               environmental inorganic silica (SiO2) and possibly nitrogen
               (NO3). When multiple background Symbiodinium occurred within an
               individual polyp, the average cell densities were positively
               correlated, suggesting non-specific processes of cell sorting
               and retention by the animal. While these findings substantiate
               the existence of a broader, yet uncharacterized, diversity of
               Symbiodinium, we conclude that only those species which can
               occur in high abundance and are temporally stable are ultimately
               important to coral-dinoflagellate mutualisms. Many transient
               Symbiodinium spp., which occur only at trace abundances in the
               coral’s microbiome, belong to different functional guilds and
               likely have little, if any, importance to a coral’s physiology.
               The successful integration between host and symbiont into a
               stable functional unit should therefore be considered when
               defining host-symbiont specificity.",

                 change on diverse organisms, with repercussions for ecosystem
                 persistence in some cases. On coral reefs, increases in
                 heat-tolerant symbionts after thermal bleaching can reduce
                 coral susceptibility to future stress. However, the relevance
                 of this adaptive response is equivocal owing to conflicting
                 reports of symbiont stability and change. We help reconcile
                 this conflict by showing that change in symbiont community
                 composition (symbiont shuffling) in Orbicella faveolata
                 depends on the disturbance severity and recovery environment.
                 The proportion of heat-tolerant symbionts dramatically
                 increased following severe experimental bleaching, especially
                 in a warmer recovery environment, but tended to decrease if
                 bleaching was less severe. These patterns can be explained by
                 variation in symbiont performance in the changing
                 microenvironments created by differentially bleached host
                 tissues. Furthermore, higher proportions of heat-tolerant
                 symbionts linearly increased bleaching resistance but reduced
                 photochemical efficiency, suggesting that any change in
                 community structure oppositely impacts performance and stress
                 tolerance. Therefore, even minor symbiont shuffling can
                 adaptively benefit corals, although fitness effects of
                 resulting trade-offs are difficult to predict. This work helps
                 elucidate causes and consequences of dynamism in symbiosis,
                 which is critical to predicting responses of multi-partner
                 symbioses such as O. faveolata to environmental change.",

  abstract    = "As coral bleaching events become more frequent and intense,
                 our ability to predict and mitigate future events depends upon
                 our capacity to interpret patterns within previous episodes.
                 Responses to thermal stress vary among coral species; however
                 the diversity of coral assemblages, environmental conditions,
                 assessment protocols, and severity criteria applied in the
                 global effort to document bleaching patterns creates
                 challenges for the development of a systemic metric of
                 taxon-specific response. Here, we describe and validate a
                 novel framework to standardize bleaching response records and
                 estimate their measurement uncertainties. Taxon-specific
                 bleaching and mortality records (2036) of 374 coral taxa
                 (during 1982-2006) at 316 sites were standardized to average
                 percent tissue area affected and a taxon-specific bleaching
                 response index (taxon-BRI) was calculated by averaging
                 taxon-specific response over all sites where a taxon was
                 present. Differential bleaching among corals was widely
                 variable (mean taxon-BRI = 25.06 $\pm$ 18.44\%, $\pm$SE).
                 Coral response may differ because holobionts are biologically
                 different (intrinsic factors), they were exposed to different
                 environmental conditions (extrinsic factors), or
                 inconsistencies in reporting (measurement uncertainty). We
                 found that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors have
                 comparable influence within a given site and event (60\% and
                 40\% of bleaching response variance of all records explained,
                 respectively). However, when responses of individual taxa are
                 averaged across sites to obtain taxon-BRI, differential
                 response was primarily driven by intrinsic differences among
                 taxa (65\% of taxon-BRI variance explained), not conditions
                 across sites (6\% explained), nor measurement uncertainty
                 (29\% explained). Thus, taxon-BRI is a robust metric of
                 intrinsic susceptibility of coral taxa. Taxon-BRI provides a
                 broadly applicable framework for standardization and error
                 estimation for disparate historical records and collection of
                 novel data, allowing for unprecedented accuracy in

                 bleaching mortality, water temperature and shading, in the

                 genotyping. A chronically warm but partly shaded coral reef in
                 a marine lake that is hydrographically well connected to the
                 surrounding waters harboured only two single-stranded

                 nonporitid species and two Porites species investigated, with
                 the remaining five Porites harbouring C*. Despite the high
                 temperature in this lake (> 0.5 degrees above ambient), this
                 reef did not suffer coral mortality during the (1998)
                 bleaching event, however, no bleaching-sensitive coral
                 families and genera occur in the coral community. This setting

                 moderate to low proportions of clade D zooxanthellae were

                 irradiance, can be composed of colonies associated with the
                 more thermo-tolerant clade D zooxanthellae. Future increases

               different Symbiodinium types to enhance the physiological
               tolerance of reef corals is not well understood. Here we compare
               the functionality and physiological properties of juvenile
               corals when experimentally infected with one of two homologous
               Symbiodinium types and exposed to combined heat and light

               chlorophyll a fluorescence, oxygen production and respiration,
               as well as pigment concentration consistently demonstrated lower
               metabolic costs and enhanced physiological tolerance of Acropora

              corals and Symbiodinium spp. The urgency to understand and
              predict the stability and breakdown of these symbioses (i.e.,
              coral ‘bleaching’) demands the development and application of
              theoretical tools. Here, we develop a dynamic bioenergetic model
              of coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that demonstrates realistic
              steady-state patterns in coral growth and symbiont abundance
              across gradients of light, nutrients, and feeding. Furthermore,
              by including a mechanistic treatment of photo-oxidative stress,
              the model displays dynamics of bleaching and recovery that can be
              explained as transitions between alternate stable states. These
              dynamics reveal that ‘healthy’ and ‘bleached’ states correspond
              broadly to nitrogen- and carbon-limitation in the system, with
              transitions between them occurring as integrated responses to
              multiple environmental factors. Indeed, a suite of complex
              emergent behaviors reproduced by the model (e.g., bleaching is
              exacerbated by nutrients and attenuated by feeding) suggests it
              captures many important attributes of the system; meanwhile, its
              modular framework and open source R code are designed to

  abstract  = "Bleaching refers to the loss of colour in symbioses between
               dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and marine
               benthic animals, e.g. corals. Bleaching generally results in
               depressed growth and increased mortality, and it can be
               considered as a deleterious physiological response or ailment.
               An explanatory framework for the causes of bleaching comprises
               three elements: the external factors or triggers of bleaching,
               e.g. elevated temperature; the symptoms, including elimination
               of algal cells and loss of algal pigment; and the mechanisms,
               which define the response of the symbiosis to the triggers,
               resulting in the observed symptoms. The extent to which
               bleaching in different symbioses and in response to different

               contribution of interactions between the algal and animal
               partners to bleaching is predicted. Symbioses vary in their
               susceptibility to bleaching as a result of genetic variation in
               Symbiodinium and acclimatory responses of the animal. The
               evolutionary explanation for bleaching is obscure. Perhaps,
               bleaching was of selective advantage to the animal hosts under
               different (more benign?) environmental conditions than the

                 symbioses with numerous protistan and invertebrate metazoan
                 hosts. However, few data on symbiont genetic structure are
                 available, hindering predictions of how these populations and
                 their host associations will fair in the face of global
                 climate change. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here,
                 Symbiodinium population structure from two of the Caribbean's
                 ecologically dominant scleractinian corals, Montastraea
                 faveolata and M. annularis, was examined. Tagged colonies on
                 Florida Keys and Bahamian (i.e., Exuma Cays) reefs were
                 sampled from 2003-2005 and their Symbiodinium diversity
                 assessed via internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA and
                 three Symbiodinium Clade B-specific microsatellite loci.
                 Generally, the majority of host individuals at a site harbored
                 an identical Symbiodinium ITS2 ``type'' B1 microsatellite
                 genotype. Notably, symbiont genotypes were largely reef
                 endemic, suggesting a near absence of dispersal between
                 populations. Relative to the Bahamas, sympatric M. faveolata
                 and M. annularis in the Florida Keys harbored unique
                 Symbiodinium populations, implying regional host specificity
                 in these relationships. Furthermore, within-colony
                 Symbiodinium population structure remained stable through time
                 and environmental perturbation, including a prolonged
                 bleaching event in 2005. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken
                 together, the population-level endemism, specificity and
                 stability exhibited by Symbiodinium raises concerns about the
                 long-term adaptive capacity and persistence of these symbioses

               fidelity to a single clade of symbiont is the dominant pattern
               in present day corals, current estimates of flexibility are
               unreliable because few studies have measured it rigorously and

               flexibility must be explored at the level of the subclade

               distinct and enduring changes in environmental conditions. The

               single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response,
               one strategy might be to identify ( 1 ) specific reef areas
               where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in
               low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (
               i.e., areas of natural ``resistance'' to bleaching ) and ( 2 )
               reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result
               in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching
               mortality has occurred ( i.e., areas of natural community
               ``resilience'' ). These ``target areas,'' where environmental
               conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and

               zooxanthellae residing within the gastrodermal tissues of host
               animals. Of particular concern are the consequences of bleaching
               of large numbers of reef-building scleractinian corals and
               hydrocorals. Published records of coral reef bleaching events
               from 1870 to the present suggest that the frequency (60 major
               events from 1979 to 1990), scale (co-occurrence in many coral
               reef regions and often over the bathymetric depth range of
               corals) and severity (>95\% mortality in some areas) of recent
               bleaching disturbances are unprecedented in the scientific
               literature. The causes of small scale, isolated bleaching events
               can often be explained by particular stressors (e.g.,
               temperature, salinity, light, sedimentation, aerial exposure and
               pollutants), but attempts to explain large scale bleaching
               events in terms of possible global change (e.g., greenhouse
               warming, increased UV radiation flux, deteriorating ecosystem
               health, or some combination of the above) have not been
               convincing. Attempts to relate the severity and extent of large
               scale coral reef bleaching events to particular causes have been
               hampered by a lack of (a) standardized methods to assess
               bleaching and (b) continuous, long-term data bases of

               competition, predation, symbioses, bioerosion and substrate

               reef recovery. If projected rates of sea warming are realized by
               mid to late AD 2000, i.e. a 2°C increase in high latitude coral

                 response of corals and their endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) to
                 prolonged environmental change is of immediate importance.
                 Here, a total of 1152 fragments from 72 colonies of three
                 common coral species (Stylophora pistillata, Pocillopora
                 damicornis, Seriatopora hystrix) underwent a 32-month
                 reciprocal depth transplantation. Genetic analysis showed that
                 while S. hystrix maintained its generalist symbiont, some S.
                 pistillata and P. damicornis underwent temporary changes in
                 resident symbionts immediately after stress (transplantation;
                 natural bleaching). These temporary changes were
                 phylogenetically constrained to 'host-compatible' symbionts
                 only and reversion to original symbionts occurred within 7 to
                 12 months, indicating long-term fidelity and stability of
                 adult symbioses. Measurements of symbiont photo-physiology
                 (dark adapted yield, pressure over photosystem II) and coral
                 health (host protein, bleaching status, mortality) indicated a
                 broad acclimatory capacity. However, this came at an apparent
                 energetic expense as disproportionate mortality amongst
                 symbioses that persisted outside their distribution range was
                 observed following a natural bleaching event. As environmental
                 changes due to climate change become more continuous in

                 tolerance range limits coupled with the inability of adult
                 coral colonies to change resident symbionts makes corals
                 particularly susceptible to additional environmental
                 fluctuations or stress events and reduces the resilience of

  author   = "Baker, Andrew C and Glynn, Peter W and Riegl, Bernhard",
  abstract = "Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and
              mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have
              occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical
              or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe
              events typically accompanying coupled ocean--atmosphere
              phenomena, such as the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
              which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean
              temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review
              the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on
              reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data
              worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss
              of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral
              community structure in many others, with a potentially critical
              influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine
              tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in
              reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown
              of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat
              for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological
              effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant
              surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of
              decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery
              have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have
              experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching
              impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral
              cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a
              single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on
              western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in
              response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set
              of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in
              the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the
              Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not.
              The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and
              recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning
              taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long
              distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a
              capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected
              reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how
              much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally
              extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral
              communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and
              other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation
              state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and
              bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience
              by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and
              coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a
              chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and
              coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are
              likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable
              constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this
              ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any
              global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of
              bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical
              coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the
              degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching
              and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well
              as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now
              recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged
              in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to
              geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to
              maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor
              bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled
              ocean--atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition
              to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching
              impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant
              reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the
              next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during
              this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover
              in the long term.",

               coral bleaching was first described. In most cases bleaching has
               been attributed to elevated temperature, but other instances
               involving high solar irradiance, and sometimes disease, have
               also been documented. It is timely, in view of our concern about
               worldwide reef condition, to review knowledge of physical and
               biological factors involved in bleaching, the mechanisms of
               zooxanthellae and pigment loss, and the ecological consequences
               for coral communities. Here we evaluate recently acquired data
               on temperature and irradiance-induced bleaching, including
               long-term data sets which suggest that repeated bleaching events
               may be the consequence of a steadily rising background sea
               temperature that will in the future expose corals to an
               increasingly hostile environment. Cellular mechanisms of
               bleaching involve a variety of processes that include the
               degeneration of zooxanthellae in situ, release of zooxanthellae
               from mesenterial filaments and release of algae within host
               cells which become detached from the endoderm. Photo-protective
               defences (particularly carotenoid pigments) in zooxanthellae are
               likely to play an important role in limiting the bleaching
               response which is probably elicited by a combination of elevated
               temperature and irradiance in the field. The ability of corals
               to respond adaptively to recurrent bleaching episodes is not
               known, but preliminary evidence suggests that phenotypic
               responses of both corals and zooxanthellae may be significant.",

                 limited information on how past thermal conditions have
                 influenced reef composition and current stress responses.
                 Using satellite temperature data for 1985-2012, the analysis
                 we present is the first to quantify, for global reef

                 stress events and temperature variability at reef-scale (~4

  abstract = "Climate warming threatens to increase mass coral bleaching
              events, and several studies have projected the demise of tropical
              coral reefs this century. However, recent evidence indicates
              corals may be able to respond to thermal stress though adaptive
              processes (e.g., genetic adaptation, acclimatization, and
              symbiont shuffling). How these mechanisms might influence
              warming-induced bleaching remains largely unknown. This study
              compared how different adaptive processes could affect coral
              bleaching projections. We used the latest bias-corrected global
              sea surface temperature (SST) output from the NOAA/GFDL Earth
              System Model 2 (ESM2M) for the preindustrial period through 2100
              to project coral bleaching trajectories. Initial results showed
              that, in the absence of adaptive processes, application of a
              preindustrial climatology to the NOAA Coral Reef Watch bleaching
              prediction method overpredicts the present-day bleaching
              frequency. This suggests that corals may have already responded
              adaptively to some warming over the industrial period. We then
              modified the prediction method so that the bleaching threshold
              either permanently increased in response to thermal history
              (e.g., simulating directional genetic selection) or temporarily
              increased for 2-10 years in response to a bleaching event (e.g.,
              simulating symbiont shuffling). A bleaching threshold that
              changes relative to the preceding 60 years of thermal history
              reduced the frequency of mass bleaching events by 20-80\%
              compared with the 'no adaptive response' prediction model by
              2100, depending on the emissions scenario. When both types of
              adaptive responses were applied, up to 14\% more reef cells
              avoided high-frequency bleaching by 2100. However, temporary
              increases in bleaching thresholds alone only delayed the
              occurrence of high-frequency bleaching by ca. 10 years in all but
              the lowest emissions scenario. Future research should test the
              rate and limit of different adaptive responses for coral species
              across latitudes and ocean basins to determine if and how much
              corals can respond to increasing thermal stress.",

               critical components of coral reef ecosystems whose loss during
               stress-related ``bleaching'' events can lead to mass mortality
               of coral hosts and associated collapse of reef ecosystems.
               Molecular studies have shown these partnerships to be more
               flexible than previously thought, with different hosts and
               symbionts showing varying degrees of specificity in their
               associations. Further studies are beginning to reveal the
               systematic, ecological, and biogeographic underpinnings of this
               flexibility. Unusual symbionts normally found only in larval
               stages, marginal environments, uncommon host taxa, or at

              because of their high reef dependence and exposure to threats. We
              conducted semi-structured interviews in 103 households,
              stratified across the atoll's five villages, to characterize
              Kiritimati's fishery, and to examine people's perceptions of the
              fishery status and their fishery dependence (assessed by
              responses to hypothetical declines in fishery catches). High
              immigration rates have created a shifting baseline in the
              community, with more recent immigrants perceiving the local

              fishery resources and limited alternatives for feeding their

                 conditions and after disturbances, and how these dynamics
                 relate to the host's health. Here we examined the natural
                 variability of prokaryotic communities (based on 16S ribosomal
                 RNA gene amplicon sequencing) associating with the surface
                 mucus layer (SML) of Porites astreoides, a species exhibiting
                 cyclical mucus aging and shedding. Shifts in the prokaryotic
                 community composition during mucus aging led to the prevalence
                 of opportunistic and potentially pathogenic bacteria
                 (Verrucomicrobiaceae and Vibrionaceae) in aged mucus and to a
                 twofold increase in prokaryotic abundance. After the release
                 of aged mucus sheets, the community reverted to its original
                 state, dominated by Endozoicimonaceae and Oxalobacteraceae.

                 depletion of its natural mucus microbiome through antibiotics
                 treatment. After re-introduction to the reef, healthy-looking
                 microbe-depleted corals started exhibiting clear signs of
                 bleaching and necrosis. Recovery versus mortality of the P.
                 astreoides holobiont was related to the degree of change in

                 in the coral Acropora muricata when subjected to increasing
                 thermal stress from 26 to 31°C, and determined whether this
                 composition correlated with any changes in the bacterial

                 Nevertheless, corals can be adapted to their thermal
                 environment and inherit heat tolerance across generations. In
                 addition, the diverse microbes that associate with corals have
                 the capacity for more rapid change, potentially aiding the
                 adaptation of long-lived corals. Here, we show that the
                 microbiome of reef corals is different across thermally
                 variable habitats and changes over time when corals are
                 reciprocally transplanted. Exposing these corals to thermal
                 bleaching conditions changes the microbiome for heat-sensitive
                 corals, but not for heat-tolerant corals growing in habitats
                 with natural high heat extremes. Importantly, particular
                 bacterial taxa predict the coral host response in a short-term
                 heat stress experiment. Such associations could result from
                 parallel responses of the coral and the microbial community to
                 living at high natural temperatures. A competing hypothesis is

                 coral reefs worldwide. Symbiotic relationships between
                 scleractinian corals and photosynthetic endosymbionts (genus
                 Symbiodinium) are the foundation of reef ecosystems, and these
                 associations are differentially impacted by stress. Here, we
                 couple empirical data from the coral reefs of Moorea, French
                 Polynesia, and a network theoretic modeling approach to
                 evaluate how patterns in coral-Symbiodinium associations
                 influence community stability under climate change. To
                 introduce the effect of climate perturbations, we simulate
                 local 'extinctions' that represent either the loss of coral
                 species or the ability to engage in symbiotic interactions.
                 Community stability is measured by determining the duration
                 and number of species that persist through the simulated
                 extinctions. Our results suggest that four factors greatly
                 increase coral-Symbiodinium community stability in response to
                 global changes: (i) the survival of generalist hosts and
                 symbionts maximizes potential symbiotic unions; (ii) elevated
                 symbiont diversity provides redundant or complementary
                 symbiotic functions; (iii) compatible symbiotic assemblages
                 create the potential for local recolonization; and (iv) the
                 persistence of certain traits associate with symbiotic
                 diversity and redundancy. Symbiodinium may facilitate coral
                 persistence through novel environmental regimes, but this
                 capacity is mediated by symbiotic specificity, association
                 patterns, and the functional performance of the symbionts. Our
                 model-based approach identifies general trends and testable
                 hypotheses in coral-Symbiodinium community responses. Future
                 studies should consider similar methods when community size

                 their success at local scales. Additionally, some corals are

                 shuffling the relative proportions of different Symbiodinium

                 requires a sensitive and quantitative method of Symbiodinium
                 genotyping. Electrophoresis methods, still widely utilized for
                 this purpose, are predominantly qualitative and cannot
                 guarantee detection of a background type below 10\% of the
                 total Symbiodinium population. Here, the relative abundances
                 of four Symbiodinium types (A13, C1, C3, and D1) in mixed
                 samples of known composition were quantified using deep
                 sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal
                 RNA gene (ITS-2) by means of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
                 using Roche 454. In samples dominated by each of the four
                 Symbiodinium types tested, background levels of the other
                 three types were detected when present at 5\%, 1\%, and 0.1\%
                 levels, and their relative abundances were quantified with
                 high (A13, C1, D1) to variable (C3) accuracy. The potential of
                 this deep sequencing method for resolving fine-scale genetic
                 diversity within a symbiont type was further demonstrated in a
                 natural symbiosis using ITS-1, and uncovered reef-specific
                 differences in the composition of Symbiodinium microadriaticum
                 in two species of acroporid corals (Acropora digitifera and A.

                 ITS locus (1 and 2) to detect and quantify low-abundant
                 Symbiodinium types, as well as finer-scale diversity below the
