FOLDERS  
  
coral99 - photos of coral 99 for figure 1, each photo labelled with field season  
  
OTUSummary - figure output from KI_Platy_analysis_OTUSummary.Rmd, use with caution, these were completed early on and should be reviewed before inclusion in presentations/manuscripts/etc  
  
FILES  
  
Figure1.R - Rscript for manuscript figure #1, showing DHW accummulation over time with images of coral99. Note that this is a slow script. I used a jpeg script from online, and full sized images, and could probably optimize this process a bit. 

Figure1.tiff

cmap_enso.csv - color bar for Figure 1 temperatures
