KI Platy qPCR Figure Ideas

All of the "data" I drew on these figures are what I expect we may see when we actually plot them. But it might be totally different! I just show the data to get an idea of how I see it being plotted for each type of figure. 

We may use more than one of these in a multi-panel figure, or think of another better way to show these data and use none of these. I think we just need to have a look at them to understand what is going on and how to talk about it...

1) Showing how symbiont to host cell ratio (S/H) changes over time at each of our sampling time points. Different colors or shapes show disturbance level. These are mean S/H ratios across each disturbance level, with either standard error bars or a shaded band around the mean.
Point: to show when bleaching occurred, how it was different between disturbance levels, and whether the corals recovered to their full complement of symbiodinium by March 2016.

2) Showing proportion of clade D changes over time at each of our sampling time points. Different colors or shapes show disturbance level. These are mean proportions across each disturbance level, with either standard error bars or a shaded band around the mean.
This could either be the overall community, but even better, a subset of corals that we followed through the event. This would necessitate more lines, so making sure it is understandable might be tricky.
Point: To show when changes in symbiont communities occurred (yes or no, preferential symbiont expulsion?)

3) Showing the relationship between symbiont abundance (S/H ratio) and proportion of Clade D. I think this may nicely separate out the dynamics that are happening at each disturbance level. Or it may be a giant mess...but I think it's worth plotting to see if it tells a useful story. Time-step and disturbance level are shown by different shapes/colors. Each point is an individual coral colony in this figure idea.
